This plugin allows you to use placeholders in your website, that can be dynamically updated.

## Features

- Easy to create input fields for users to change placeholder values
- Uses localStorage, so you (probably) don't need a cookie banner. Data will persistent across visits unless the user's browser is configured to clear the data (private browsing mode)
- You can dynamically alter placeholder values using JavaScript.

## Caveats

- Only visible text is replaced. So for example link targets are not a valid place where placeholders can be used.
