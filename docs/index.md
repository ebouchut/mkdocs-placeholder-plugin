This plugin allows you to use placeholders in your website, that can be dynamically updated.

## Features

- Easy to create input fields for users to change placeholder values.
- Uses localStorage, so you (probably) don't need a cookie banner. Data will persistent across visits unless the user's browser is configured to clear the data (private browsing mode)
- You can dynamically alter placeholder values using JavaScript.
- You can automatically add inputs for all placeholders used on a page.


## Versioning

Generally smaller version updates (for example `0.2.4` -> `0.2.5`) can contain new features and bug fixes that do not *significantly* break backwards compatibility.
Minor version updates (`0.1.X` -> `0.2.0`) will have significant breaking changes, so you will want to check the [changelog](https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-placeholder-plugin#notable-changes) before updating.
You should probably also use version pinning, to make sure that you do not install new versions (without checking that they do not break your config first).
