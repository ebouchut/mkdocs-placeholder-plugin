- dynamic replacements
- Optional extra buttons for the global placeholder state (reset, import, export)
- Clean up the config file options to be more intuitive
- Static replacement on a per placeholder basis
- Formatters (such as for bash-shell) for escaping characters that may break the command that a placeholder is part of
- Advanced placeholders (placeholders for not often used/very technical fields) whose visibility can be toggled in auto tables
- new validators: mac address, email
- decouple from mkdocs -> make it easy to port to other site generators
