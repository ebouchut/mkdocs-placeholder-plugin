- Optional extra buttons for the global placeholder state (reset, import, export)
- Clean up the config file options to be more intuitive
- Add hooks (for getting initial values for placeholders)
- Static replacement on a per placeholder basis
- Formatters (such as for bash-shell) for escaping characters that may break the command that a placeholder is part of
- Validators for common value types (IPv4 address, hostname, port number, file path, URL) and custom ones based on user supplied regular expressions
