- Optional extra buttons for the global placeholder state (reset, import, export)
- Static replacement on a per placeholder basis
- Implement propper exception handling for TypeScript code to recover from / compartmentalize non-critical errors.
- Formatters (such as for bash-shell) for escaping characters that may break the command that a placeholder is part of
- Advanced placeholders (placeholders for not often used/very technical fields) whose visibility can be toggled in auto tables
    - Or even more powerful: Categories that can be toggled individually
- new validators: mac address, email, number, uuid, linux username, linux network interface name
- Better styling for mkdocs material
- per page options (like disabling the insertion of an placeholder input table at the top)
    - maybe only insert if no table is already defined on the page
- idea: debug option / style that shows which placeholder changes will require a page reload
- idea: add number of placeholders to title of table
- fix: hide empty fallback html tables
- fix: move default placeholder table after the heading `<h1>`, instead of above it
- Improve behavior on really large pages (as ceated by print-page plugin)
    - segment tables and only let them run in their own segment -> do now show a hunch of unnecessary placeholders that are referenced way farther down the site
- performance: add options to disable specific replace methods
- fix: page flashes, maybe related to input tables? -> move fallback in `noscript` tag?
