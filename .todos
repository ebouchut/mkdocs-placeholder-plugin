- What about the search entries? Can I hook into them for the normal MkDocs and the MkDocs for material plugins?
- Optional extra buttons for the global placeholder state (reset, import, export)
- clean up the config file options to be more intuitive
- Add hooks (for getting [initial] values for placeholders)
