- Optional extra buttons for the global placeholder state (reset, import, export)
- Static replacement on a per placeholder basis
- Formatters (such as for bash-shell) for escaping characters that may break the command that a placeholder is part of
- Advanced placeholders (placeholders for not often used/very technical fields) whose visibility can be toggled in auto tables
    - Or even more powerful: Categories that can be toggled individually
- new validators: mac address, email
- Better styling for mkdocs material
